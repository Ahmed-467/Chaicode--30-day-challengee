// Day 2: Operators Tasks/Activities:

// Feature Request:

// 1. Arithmetic Operations Script: Write a script that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, remainder) on two numbers and logs the results.

// 2. Comparison and Logical Operators Script: Create a script that compares two numbers using different comparison operators and combines conditions using logical operators, logging the results. 3. Ternary Operator Script: Write a script that uses the ternary operator to determine if a number is positive or negative and logs the result.

// Achievement:
// By the end of these activities, students will:
// • Understand and use arithmetic operators to perform basic calculations.
// • Use assignment operators to modify variable values.
// • Compare values using comparison operators.
// • Combine conditions using logical operators.
// • Use the ternary operator for concise conditional expressions.





// / • Task 1: Write a program to add two numbers and log the result to the console.log

const number_1 = 5;
const number_2 = 4;
const add = number_1 + number_2;
console.log(add);

// • Task 2: Write a program to subtract two numbers and log the result to the console.log

let number_3 = 4;
let number_4 = 5;
let subtract = number_3 + number_4
console.log(subtract);

// • Task 4: Write a program to divide two numbers and log the result to the console.log
